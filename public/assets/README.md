# Assets Directory

This directory is for static assets like images, fonts, or other files.

## Note

Video files are no longer used. The interface now uses a Canvas-based animation (`VideoCanvas` component) that:
- Always works without external files
- Provides smooth 60fps animation
- Looks like real video with rotating particles and pulsing orbs
- No loading time or network requests needed
